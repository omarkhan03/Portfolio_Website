# **This is NOT the repository for my portfolio website!**

[Click here to go to the real repository](https://github.com/omarkhan03/oakhan.github.io)

The only reason I have this is because I initially created my portfiolio website with the URL "omarkhan03.github.io/Portfolio_Website", but that URL is 
too long so I changed it to simply "omarkhan03.github.io". 

In order to avoid confusion, I decided to deploy this page which redirects from the old address to the new address of my portfolio website.
